# just to make a package....

# although...

# pynsource maybe shouldn't be treated as a package 
# (and nor installed by the root ..\setup.py) as a package into \PythonXX\Lib\site-packages\pynsource
# Currently its more a utility script
# though maybe I can tweak it a bit so its drivable like a more hard core package
# in the future.
